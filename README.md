# Dashboard_ReactJS
Dashboard using reactJS for education purpose.

Quick Start:

Using NPM
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Make sure the installed Node version is >= 8.10 and of npm >= 5.6

After installing Node.js, open a terminal and run npm install in the main volt-react-dashboard/ folder to download all project dependencies. You'll find them in the node_modules/ folder.

	npm install

Then start the app in development mode by running the following command in terminal:

	npm run start

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

If you want to generate the production files, change the homepage value from the package.json to the domain name that the app will be hosted on, and then run the following command in the terminal:

	npm run build
